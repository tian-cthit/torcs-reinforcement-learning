# Path Planning using Reinforcement Learning and Objective Data

DQN is used for learning option level policy and DDPG is used for learning intra-policies. Under several traffic and vehicle dynamic constraints, the learning algorithms learns to perform the autonomous driving tasks efficiently. Several experiments are performed to study the proper combination of reward functions.
